# Contributing to Addax

Thanks for your interest in Addax.  Our goal is to build a comprehensive data integration platform that covers all data integration requirements.

## Getting Started

Addax's [open issues are here](https://github.com/wgzhao/addax/issues). Issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors with the `beginner-task` tag. An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. Issues can include bugs, new features, or documentation that looks outdated. 

## Contributions

Addax welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to Addax should be made in the form of GitHub pull request submissions and reviews. 

Each pull request submission will be reviewed by a contributor or [wgzhao](https://github.com/wgzhao) 
in the project. Only wgzhao may merge a pull request. Large contributions should have an associated Github issue.

Pull request reviews are encouraged for anyone in the community who would like to contribute to Addax, and are
expected from contributors and committers in at least equal proportion to their code contributions.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Test Cases are expected for all bug fixes and new features.

- Make sure your code follows the [code style guidelines](https://github.com/wgzhao/addax#code-style).

- Ensure that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
      When possible, the size of the commit should be reduced for ease of review, while still ensuring
      that it is independently correct.

 - Make sure commit messages [follow these guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).  In particular (from the guidelines):

        * Separate subject from body with a blank line
        * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
        * Capitalize the subject line
        * Do not end the subject line with a period
        * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
        * Wrap the body at 72 characters
        * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
